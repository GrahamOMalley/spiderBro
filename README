This python script takes a list of tv shows, scrapes thetvdb.com and the xbmc mysql db, and creates a list of missing episodes. 

It then uses BeautifulSoup to search the pirate bay and btjunkie for these episodes, and adds them to deluge via the deluge rpc interface.

Currently, only the mysql xbmc db is supported - it would be trivial to rewrite this to use the standard sqlite db, but as I don't use this I probably won't add support in the foreseeable future.

The script requires that a table called urls_seen is available (in the xbmc db or in a different one, currently need to hand edit the db connection params in the script to change this)

The table takes the form:
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| showname | varchar(64) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| episode  | varchar(64) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| url      | varchar(64) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+

There also needs to be another table in the schema, called "finished_shows", that takes the form:

+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| showname | varchar(64) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
